Introduction to The Design & Analysis of Algorithms, 2nd Edition
Anany Levitin, Villanova University
 
Valued by students and trusted by instructors, Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms employs a comprehensive taxonomy of algorithm design techniques that is more powerful and intuitive than the traditional approach.
 
It provides a coherent and pedagogically sound framework for learning and teaching algorithms. An extensive, detailed solutions manual is available online for the benefit of students and instructors. Student learning is further supported by exercise hints and chapter summaries. Popular puzzles and games provide motivation for students, and rhetorical questioning serves as an effective learning device.
 
Ideal for a basic course in the design and analysis of algorithms, this Second Edition features 80 new puzzles and exercises, as well as:

+ Separate sections on the analysis of nonrecursive and recursive algorithms
+ Coverage of empirical analysis and algorithm visualization
+ Revised section on approximation algorithms
+ Brand-new chapter on iterative improvement algorithms covering the simplex method, network flows, maximum matching in bipartite graphs, and the stable marriage problem
